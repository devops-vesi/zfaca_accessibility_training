# SAPUI5 Accessibility in Action: Building Inclusive Fiori Apps

## ZFACA_ACCESSIBILITY

This project can be launched in **two different ways**, depending on your working environment:

---

## 🚀 Option 1. Run with GitHub Codespaces (**Recommended**)

Codespaces allows you to start coding immediately without any local setup (although you will need a GitHub account).

✅ You will be ready to code in seconds - **no local installation required**.

### 🔧 Steps

1. **Create your own repository**

👉 [Create from template](https://github.com/devops-vesi/zfaca_accessibility_training/generate)

- Name your repo: `ui5con-accessibility-workshop-yourname`
- Leave all checkboxes **unchecked**
- Click **“Create repository”**

2. **Open in Codespaces**

- Open your newly created repository
- Click **Code > Codespaces "tab" > Create codespace on main**

- Wait for the dependencies to install automatically

#### ▶️ Launch the app

In the terminal type:
```
npm start
```

- Go to "test" folder

## 💻 Option 2. Run on a traditional development environment (VSCode or BAS)

You can also clone the project and run it from **Visual Studio Code** or **Business Application Studio (BAS)**.

---

### 🖥️ **A. Visual Studio Code**

#### ⚙️ Prerequisites

1. Download and Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
2. Download and Install the latest (LTS) version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)  
3. Download and Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)  
4. Install **SAP Fiori Tools – Extension Pack** from the VSCode marketplace.

#### 📥 Clone and configure

5. Open VSCode console then configure Git by typing:
    ```
    git config --global user.name "LASTNAME Firstname"
    git config --global user.email "xxxx@xxxxxx.com"
    git config --global http.sslVerify false
    ```

6. Clone the repository:
    - Open VSCode
    - In the command palette, type:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/devops-vesi/zfaca_accessibility_training.git
        ```

7. Open a terminal, go to the project folder and install dependencies:
    ```
    cd zfaca_accessibility_training
    ```
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    ![](./webapp/images/vscode-install.png)

#### ▶️ Launch the app

In VSCode terminal:

### ☁️ **B. Business Application Studio (BAS)**

#### 📥 Clone and configure

1. Open BAS and a new terminal.

2. Configure Git:
    ```
    git config --global user.name "LASTNAME Firstname"
    git config --global user.email "xxxx@vinci-energies.com"
    ```

3. Clone the repository:
    - In the BAS command palette, type:
        ```
        >Git: Clone
        ```
        ![](./webapp/images/bas-clone.png)

    - Paste the repository URL:
        ```
        https://github.com/devops-vesi/zfaca_accessibility_training.git
        ```

4. Open the terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal)  
   Make sure you are in the project folder.

5. Install packages:
    ```
    npm install

**Note:**
This project was originally presented during a **UI5con 2025** session titled:

> **SAPUI5 Accessibility in Action: Building Inclusive Fiori Apps**

The session introduced the fundamentals of IT accessibility and demonstrated how to apply them in SAPUI5 applications through live coding and hands-on exercises.


📄 You can find the introductory slides for this session in PDF format [here](./slides/UI5con_2025_SAPUI5_Accessibility_in_Action_Building_inclusive_Fiori_Apps.pdf).
