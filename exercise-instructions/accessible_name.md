# 📝 Exercise – Accessible Name

## 📚 Introduction

An accessible name is a short string, typically 1 to 3 words, associated with an element to provide users of assistive technologies with a label for the element.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

An accessible name serves two primary purposes for users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers:

- **Convey the purpose or intent** of the element.
- **Distinguish the element** from other elements on the page.

🔗 **Resources:**
- [Mozilla Accessible Name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)
- [WAI Accessible Name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G208)

## 🖼️ Static Visual Content

### 🔹 Decorative Visual Elements

- If visual content is purely **decorative**, it should be **ignored** by assistive technologies.
- SAP provides a `decorative` property to ignore visual content like the image path if the alt is missing or unnecessary information.

---

### 🔹 Informative Visual Elements

- The **information** provided by the image must be available to everyone. This is done through **alternative text**.

## 🔧 Interactive Elements

### 🔹 Text Interactive Components

- For a text button, the **accessible name** is implicit.
- For a field, the **accessible name** is also the **label** rather than the placeholder, which is input guidance.

### 🔹 Icon Only Interactive Components

- For an **icon only button**, the accessible name is provided by the tooltip: `[aria-label] + [title]`.
