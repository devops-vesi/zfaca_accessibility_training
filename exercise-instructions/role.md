# 📝 Exercise - #1 Role

## 📚 Introduction

Roles provide **semantic meaning** to content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object.

---

## 🔧 Usage

ARIA roles can be used to describe elements that don't natively exist in HTML or exist but don't yet have full browser support.

By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role, for example:

```html
<input type="radio"> <!-- has the "radio" role -->
```

Non-semantic elements in HTML do not have a role;  
`<div>` and `<span>` without added semantics return null. The **role attribute provides semantics** to them.

- **Widget roles**: e.g. Searchbox, Slider, Spinbutton, Switch, Tab, Combobox, Menu
- **Landmark roles**: e.g. Banner, Contentinfo, Main, Navigation, Region, Search
- **Live region roles**: e.g. Alert, Status, Timer
- **Window roles**: e.g. Alertdialog, Dialog

## 🔬 Comparison of Generated HTML

Below is a **comparison of radio button implementations** in AngularJS vs UI5:

### 🔹 Radio Button in AngularJS

```html
<input _ngcontent-xxa-c185 id="typePresence_2" type="radio" name="typePresenceRadio" class="ng-untouched ng-pristine ng-valid">
```
![Radio Button AngularJS](./images/angular_radio_inspector.png)

Generates an:

```html
<input type="radio">
```

---

### 🔹 Radio Button in UI5

```html
<div id="__button1" data-sap-ui="__button1" role="radio" aria-checked="false" aria-labelledby="__button1-label" tabindex="-1" class="sapMRb sapMRbHasLabel"> flex
</div>
```

![Radio Button UI5](./images/ui5_radio_inspector.png)

Generates a:

```html
<div role="radio"></div>
```
