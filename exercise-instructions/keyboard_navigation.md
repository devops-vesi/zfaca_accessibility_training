# 📝 Exercise - #4 Keyboard Navigation

## 📚 Introduction

All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface **without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes**, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

If all functionality can be achieved **using the keyboard**, it can be accomplished by keyboard users, by **speech input** (which creates keyboard input), by **mouse** (using on-screen keyboards), and by a **wide variety of assistive technologies** that create simulated keystrokes as their output.

## 💡 Focus Handling Example

Help keyboard users to navigate when the order changes:

**Case 1:**

- The collapse header arrow button adds filters before the content.
- **Screen reader users are not informed** of the content added above.
