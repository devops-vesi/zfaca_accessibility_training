# 📝 Exercise – #3 Error Management & Context Changes

## 📚 Introduction

The intent is to ensure:

- Users are aware that an **error has occurred** and can determine what is wrong.
- Users receive **appropriate suggestions** for correction of an input error if possible.
- Users avoid **serious consequences** as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Providing information about input errors in text allows users to:

- Perceive that an **error occurred**.
- Understand how to **correct input errors** to fill in forms successfully, reducing the number of times they need to change input values.
- Be protected from **serious consequences** resulting from mistakes, especially users with disabilities who may be more likely to make mistakes.

## 📝 Forms Best Practices

### 🔹 Associate Label and Field

- Labels must be **associated to the field** to provide an accessible name to screen readers.
- **Placeholder** is an input hint, not an accessible name.

---

### 🔹 Grouping Fields

- **Group fields** when they answer the same question.
- Add a **legend** and bind it to the group.

## 💡 Provide Input Assistance

- Ensure the **input control is accessible**.
- Provide **sample data formats** where necessary in labels and error messages.

## 💬 Provide Feedback

- Provide **feedback visually** and for screen readers.
- Give **enough time to read**.

**Solution:** Visible labels and explicit error control.

## 📚 Context Changes – Introduction

Major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously.

Changes in context include changes of:

- **user agent**
- **viewport**
- **focus**
- **content** that changes the meaning of the Web page

---

### 💡 Example

Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.

- [Change on Request](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/change-on-request.html)
- [Help](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/help.html)

### 📝 Give a feedback when a large section of the page is updated
Use an invisible text or a toast message to notify screen reader users.
